    "1. Upload the dataset from MelanomaDetection.zip to the GPU server. Note that strictly speaking, you do not have to use a GPU for completing this milestone. This stepâ€™s objective is to make sure that you know how to get your dataset onto wherever your GPU is, and access it from there.\n",

    "   * __init__(self, dir_path, transform=None): the constructor should take in a path to the directory containing images and an optional transform argument for image pre-processing and augmentation.\n",
