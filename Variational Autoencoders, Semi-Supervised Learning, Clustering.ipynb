    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get first-hand experience in generative modeling by training a Variational Autoencoder on the MNIST set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a VAE generating images of handwritten digits on the MNIST set. You might want to start with a simple autoencoder and build up from there.\n",
    "1. Note that in order to test a regular autoencoder, you should put through it images from the test set. However, in order to test the generative capabilities of a VAE, you should use vectors of random noise. If you plan on displaying the generated images throughout training, it is a good idea to keep the noise vector constant, so that you can directly follow the progress of your generative model.\n",
